# Warpinator ROM Manager
Moves ROMs from the Warpinator directory to your emulator directories.

Put the scripts on your desktop or wherever. Run `Move ROMs from Warpinator.sh` whenever you have ROMs you want to move. `warpinator-rom-manager.sh` has to be in the same directory, unless you edit the other script to point to its new location. Edit it if you use non-default directory structures or want to change its behavior.
